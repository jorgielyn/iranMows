                                    Alucard is a very strong hero, when he is sufficiently farmed, especially when he is ahead in farm. 
                                    He is able to burst down the squishy enemy heroes within mere seconds and yet still have the ability
                                    to continue fighting in fights with the low cooldown of his skills, bringing the team to victory if played right.

                                        Vexana used to be the gentle and kind-hearted queen of that kingdom. 
                                        But due to the heinous deeds of an evil being, Vexana was coaxed to follow the path of darkness. 
                                        To this day, Vexana lives onâ€”not as benevolent queen, but as a malevolent demon queen of darkness.
                                        She is known as an accursed being who wields the power of curses. 
                                        She can summon darkness on a whim and lay waste to everything in her sight.
